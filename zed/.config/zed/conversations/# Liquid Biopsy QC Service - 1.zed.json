Summary of QC metrics for the sample\n2. Pass/Fail status for each metric\n3. Visual representation of key metrics\n4. Recommendations for failed metrics\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions to improve LBSQC are welcome.

Information**:\n   - Sample ID\n   - Configuration version\n   - Date of analysis\n\n2. **QC Checks**:\n   - **Coverage Ratio Check**: Evaluates the ratio between priority 1 and priority 2 gene coverage\n   - **Coverage Completeness Check**: Analyzes the percentage of fully covered priority regions\n   - **Duplicate Percentage Check**: Verifies if duplicate rate is within acceptable limits\n   - **Off-target Reads Check**: Ensures capture efficiency is adequate\n   - **Total Reads Check**: Confirms sufficient sequencing depth\n\n3. **Estimations**:\n   - **Minimal VAF and LoD**: Estimates the theoretical limit of detection\n   - **Insert Size Analysis**: Reports the fraction of reads with small insert sizes (≤150 bp)\n\nEach check has a status (success, warning, or error) and a detailed message explaining the result. For certain checks, additional data is provided, such as lists of affected genes.
