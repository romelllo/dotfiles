And how then build the pdf file from it?\nThanks in advance!\n# PDF Preview and Build for LaTeX in Zed\n\nZed doesn't have native LaTeX PDF preview or build functionality built in yet. Here's how you can work with LaTeX files in Zed:\n\n## Current Options\n\n1. **Use External Tools**: \n   - Edit your LaTeX files in Zed\n   - Use command-line tools like `pdflatex`, `latexmk`, or `tectonic` in a separate terminal to compile\n   - Open the resulting PDF in your PDF viewer of choice\n\n2. **Use Tasks in Zed**:\n   - Create custom tasks in your project's `.zed/tasks.json` file\n   - For example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tasks\": {\n    \"build-latex\": {\n      \"command\": \"latexmk -pdf document.tex\",\n      \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. **External PDF Viewers**:\n   - Use a PDF viewer that auto-refreshes when the file changes (like Skim on macOS, Evince on Linux, SumatraPDF on Windows)\n\n## Future Possibilities\n\nZed is actively developing and might add LaTeX-specific features in the future. You can:\n\n1. Check the [Zed GitHub repository](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed) for updates\n2. Consider suggesting this feature in their discussions or issues section\n\n## Alternative Workflow\n\nIf you need integrated PDF preview now, consider using VS Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension as an alternative until Zed implements similar functionality.\nI use mac. How to use Skim for rendering pdf with auto-refreshes?\n\n# Working with LaTeX in Zed on macOS\n\nCurrently, Zed doesn't have a built-in PDF preview for LaTeX files, but you can set up an efficient workflow with Skim for auto-refreshing PDF previews.\n\n## Setting Up Skim for Auto-Refresh\n\n1. **Install Skim** if you haven't already:\n   ```\n   brew install --cask skim\n   ```\n   Or download from [Skim's website](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io/)\n\n2. **Configure Skim settings**:\n   - Open Skim\n   - Go to Skim → Preferences → Sync\n   - Check \"Check for file changes\" \n   - Set it to \"Auto\" for automatic refresh when the PDF changes\n\n## Creating a LaTeX Build Task in Zed\n\n1. **Create a tasks.json file** in your project:\n   - Create a `.zed` folder in your project root if it doesn't exist\n   - Create a `tasks.json` file inside this folder\n\n2. **Add a LaTeX build task**:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"tasks\": {\n       \"build-latex\": {\n         \"command\": \"latexmk -pdf -pvc document.tex\",\n         \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n       }\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n   \n   Replace `document.tex` with your actual .tex filename.\n\n3. **Run the task**:\n   - Press `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette\n   - Type \"Tasks: Run Task\" and select it\n   - Choose \"build-latex\" from the menu\n\n## Alternative Quick Setup\n\nIf you prefer a simpler approach without tasks.json:\n\n1. **Open a terminal** in Zed (Ctrl+backtick or View → Terminal)\n\n2. **Run the latexmk command**:\n   ```\n   latexmk -pdf -pvc document.tex\n   ```\n   \n   The `-pvc` flag makes latexmk continuously watch for file changes and rebuild automatically.\n\n3. **Open the PDF in Skim** and it will refresh whenever the PDF is rebuilt.\n\n## Needed Tools\n\n- **latexmk**: Install with `brew install latexmk` \n- **LaTeX distribution**: Install MacTeX with `brew install --cask mactex`\n\nThis setup lets you edit your LaTeX files in Zed while having Skim automatically show the updated PDF whenever you save your changes.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":235}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":61},"start":122,"metadata":{"role":"system","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":236}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":62},"start":1406,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":237}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":157},"start":1473,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":238}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":158},"start":3374,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":239}}}],"summary":"LaTeX PDF preview in Zed","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}],"thought_process_output_sections":[]}
