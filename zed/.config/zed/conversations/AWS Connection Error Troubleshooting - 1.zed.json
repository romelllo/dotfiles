To help you resolve this issue, I would need more specific information about the error you're encountering. Could you please provide:\n\n1. The exact error message you're receiving\n2. What AWS service you're trying to connect to (EC2, S3, etc.)\n3. What method you're using to connect (AWS CLI, SDK, Console)\n4. Any relevant code snippets if you're using an SDK\n\nCommon connection issues with AWS include:\n- Incorrect credentials or expired access keys\n- Network connectivity problems\n- IAM permission issues\n- Region configuration problems\n- Security group or firewall restrictions\n\nOnce you provide more details about your specific error, I can give you more targeted troubleshooting steps.\nI want to save all the pdfs from this path on s3 to the list:\ns3://ctl-public-fs/kronika_docs_pdf/\n# Accessing PDFs from S3 Path\n\nTo list and potentially download all PDFs from the S3 path `s3://ctl-public-fs/kronika_docs_pdf/`, you'll need to use the AWS SDK (boto3 in Python). Here's a solution:\n\n## Python Solution with boto3\n\n```python\nimport boto3\nfrom botocore.exceptions import NoCredentialsError, ClientError\n\ndef list_pdfs_in_s3_folder(bucket_name, folder_prefix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Lists all PDF files in the specified S3 bucket folder\n    \n    Args:\n        bucket_name (str): The S3 bucket name\n        folder_prefix (str): The folder prefix within the bucket\n    \n    Returns:\n        list: List of PDF file keys (paths)\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n        \n        # Make sure folder_prefix ends with a forward slash\n        if not folder_prefix.endswith('/'):\n            folder_prefix += '/'\n            \n        # List objects in the folder\n        response = s3_client.list_objects_v2(\n            Bucket=bucket_name,\n            Prefix=folder_prefix\n        )\n        \n        # Extract PDF files from the response\n        pdf_files = []\n        if 'Contents' in response:\n            for obj in response['Contents']:\n                key = obj['Key']\n                if key.lower().endswith('.pdf'):\n                    pdf_files.append(key)\n                    \n        return pdf_files\n    \n    except NoCredentialsError:\n        print(\"AWS credentials not found. Please configure your AWS credentials.\")\n        return []\n    except ClientError as e:\n        print(f\"AWS Error: {e}\")\n        return []\n\n# Example usage\nbucket_name = 'ctl-public-fs'\nfolder_prefix = 'kronika_docs_pdf'\n\npdf_list = list_pdfs_in_s3_folder(bucket_name, folder_prefix)\n\n# Print the PDF list\nif pdf_list:\n    print(f\"Found {len(pdf_list)} PDF files:\")\n    for pdf in pdf_list:\n        print(f\" - {pdf}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No PDF files found or error occurred\")\n```\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. **AWS Credentials**: You need to have valid AWS credentials configured\n   - Use `aws configure` if using AWS CLI\n   - Set environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n   - Use IAM roles if running on EC2/Lambda\n\n2. **Required Permissions**: Your IAM user or role needs at least `s3:ListBucket` permission for the bucket\n\n3. **Required Package**: Install boto3 if you don't have it\n   ```\n   pip install boto3\n   ```\n\n## Handling Large Numbers of Files\n\nIf the bucket contains many files, you'll need to handle pagination:\n\n```python\ndef list_all_pdfs_with_pagination(bucket_name, folder_prefix):\n    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')\n    pdf_files = []\n    \n    paginator = s3_client.get_paginator('list_objects_v2')\n    pages = paginator.paginate(\n        Bucket=bucket_name,\n        Prefix=folder_prefix\n    )\n    \n    for page in pages:\n        if 'Contents' in page:\n            for obj in page['Contents']:\n                key = obj['Key']\n                if key.lower().endswith('.pdf'):\n                    pdf_files.append(key)\n    \n    return pdf_files\n```\n\nLet me know if you need help with downloading these PDFs as well!\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4052}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":24},"start":44,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4053}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":25},"start":781,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4054}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":104},"start":880,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4055}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":105},"start":3937,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":4056}}}],"summary":"AWS Connection Error Troubleshooting","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
