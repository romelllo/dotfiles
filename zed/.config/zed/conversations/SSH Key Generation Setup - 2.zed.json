How to do it?\n\nI'll help you generate SSH keys and add them to the SSH agent. Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n```bash\n# 1. Generate the SSH key pair\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ctlab\n\n# 2. Start the SSH agent in the background\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n\n# 3. Add the private key to the SSH agent\nssh-add ~/.ssh/ctlab\n```\n\nAfter running these commands:\n- The private key will be saved as `~/.ssh/ctlab`\n- The public key will be saved as `~/.ssh/ctlab.pub`\n- The key will be loaded into your SSH agent\n\nIf you want to see the contents of your public key (to copy it to a service like GitHub), you can use:\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/ctlab.pub\n```\n\nMake sure to set the correct permissions:\n```bash\nchmod 600 ~/.ssh/ctlab\nchmod 644 ~/.ssh/ctlab.pub\n```\nHow to write not a device name at the end of the key, but work email?\nTo add your email address to the SSH key, you can modify the ssh-keygen command like this:\n\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ctlab -C \"your.email@work.com\"\n```\n\nFor example, if your work email is john.doe@company.com:\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/ctlab -C \"john.doe@company.com\"\n```\n\nThe `-C` flag adds a comment to the end of the public key, which is typically used for identification purposes. This doesn't affect the functionality of the key, it just helps identify which key belongs to whom when managing multiple keys.\n\nThen continue with the same steps as before:\n```bash\neval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\nssh-add ~/.ssh/ctlab\n```\n\nYou can verify the email is attached to the key by viewing the public key:\n```bash\ncat ~/.ssh/ctlab.pub\n```\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1782}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":11},"start":6,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1783}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":116},"start":118,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1784}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":117},"start":852,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1785}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":255},"start":922,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1786}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":256},"start":1683,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":1787}}}],"summary":"SSH Key Generation Setup","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
